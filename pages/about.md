# About Page

## About Me

Hello, My name is Obsa. Welcome to my blog. This is my first blog and first time building a site with a static site generator. A little bit about me is that I am currently a grad student persuing a Masters in CS. 

## About the Site

The goal and purpose of this site is to document my progress. It is going to be a bit messy, because I have many different passions and interests in the field of CS and want to document them all here. I will also be showing where I came from by blogging about past projects and what I learned from them. It will mostly be a site filled with Data Science work and some Web Development. Hopefully in the future I will incorporate some Mobile programming.
