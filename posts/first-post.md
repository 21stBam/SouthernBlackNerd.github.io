# First Blog Post

Welcome to my first blog post. This blog is going to document my progress as well as show off some projects that I have worked on and am working on. I will discuss my thoughts and plans as well.

## Deep Learning/ Data Science
 Most of my posts going forward will be about my progress learning deep learning. I have been dabling in Data Science for some time, since listening to a few ACM talks at my school. I have taken Data Mining, Computer Vision, and Big Data courses, so the next area I would like to explore is Deep Learning. For this, I will be exploring 2019 FastAI's 7 week course, which I will be doing over 8 weeks. 

 The first week will be running through each video each day, and trying to grasp the larger concepts. Then after the first week, I will be going back over each video and doing a deep dive. I will also be reviewing 2018 and 2017's materials on the same to[pic to see how the field has progressed over the years. 

 I will be trying to document my progress each week as well as showing some of the code I wrote as well as the results. 

 ## Web Programming

 Most of my experience web programming is in Java and Python with Spring boot and Flask respectively. I'd love to explore Django, so in the future I may add that to my plate as well.
